# 📝 Forms in Flask – General Guide

Flask allows users to interact with web applications using **HTML forms** for tasks such as logging in, searching, or submitting data.

---

## 📥 What Are Forms in Flask?

Forms are the interface between the user and the server. Flask captures submitted form data using the `request` object, and processes it in your route logic.

For added security and flexibility, Flask integrates with **Flask-WTF**, which simplifies form validation, CSRF protection, and more.

## 🧰 Covered Topics & Order

This guide includes the following sections:

### 1️⃣ Flask-WTF

- Uses WTForms to define form structure using Python classes.
- Offers field types like `StringField`, `PasswordField`, `RadioField`, `FileField`, etc.
- Built-in validation and easy rendering with Jinja2.
- Automatically adds CSRF tokens to protect from malicious submissions.

🧠 _Flask-WTF is your go-to for managing secure, clean, and validated forms._

---

### 2️⃣ File Uploads

- File inputs are handled with `request.files['file']`.
- HTML forms need `enctype="multipart/form-data"`.
- Uploaded files can be saved locally using `.save()`.

⚡ _Perfect for user profile pictures, PDFs, or media files._

---

### 3️⃣ CSRF Protection

- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a threat where attackers submit forms on behalf of users without consent.
- Flask-WTF includes automatic CSRF token support.
- Tokens are embedded into forms and verified on submission.

🔐 _This is critical for any form that changes user data._
