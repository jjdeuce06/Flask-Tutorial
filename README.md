# Flask Web Framework Tutorial

**Flask** is a lightweight and powerful web framework for Python. Often referred to as a *"micro-framework"*, Flask provides the essential tools for web development without unnecessary complexity. Unlike frameworks like Django—which include built-in features such as authentication and an admin panel—Flask keeps things minimal, allowing developers to add only what they need.

This tutorial walks you through the full development process with Flask, covering:

- ✅ Setup and installation
- ✅ Routing and templating
- ✅ Authentication
- ✅ Database integration
- ✅ Deployment strategies

Whether you're just starting with Flask or exploring advanced features, this guide is designed to help you build scalable, maintainable web applications.
